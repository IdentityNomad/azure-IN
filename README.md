Delegation of administrative authority in Microsoft Azure

Identity Nomad is a tool for managing delegation of administrative rights in Microsoft Azure and Active Directory.

The management of group membership is typically done by central IT but in large organizations it can be more effective and secure to delegate this to system owners and business managers. They have the fine grained knowledge of who need access to what. If the tools can be made simple enough yet secure enough these rights can be delegated. Identity Nomad does this by utilizing existing infrastructure in form of groups, identities and workflow handling in Microsoft Azure Active Directory and Azure Service Bus. The tool is web based and intuitive.

In mid-2015 Identity Nomad will be available for download and the source code will be on GitHub.
